# Malware and Payload samples for TI assignment.

### NOTE: Groups like DarkVishnya and Gallmaker who do not use malware at all in their campaigns leave no artifacts behind. So far, no malware or payload samples have been found. Although attempts are made to contact Kaspersky and Symantec to gain access to the payloads, we are awaiting their reply.
